# Issues 
You can reach the app on: https://sas2py.streamlit.app/

You can load it loacaly by following these instructions:
- Clone repository
- Install `requirements.txt`
- Run `streamlit run 'main.py'` in terminal
  - If terminal asks to add email, type any random email
  - Click one of the local urls returned in the terminal. Should look like this:
  ~~~
  local URL: http://localhost....
  Network URL: http://192.168...
  ~~~

To do:
- Remove cycles from I/O graph
- Review and fix session states
- ~~Add node feature buttons to pyvis~~
- ~~Bring back the double-click:copy node name~~
- ~~Clean requirements.txt libraries~~
- ~~Accept import of txt only~~
- ~~Need directed network graphs~~
- ~~Need to clean inputs/outputs: turn db.X to X if X among self.inputs~~
